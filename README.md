Welcome to my first C++ game project! This project uses raylib, a simple and easy-to-use library for creating 2D games.
Prerequisites

    A C++ compiler, such as Visual C++ or GCC
    raylib, which can be installed using vcpkg or by manually building and installing the library

To build and run the game, follow these steps:

    Clone this repository to your local machine
    Navigate to the project directory in a terminal or command prompt
    Run the following command to build the game: make
    Run the game by executing the generated executable file: ./game

Playing the Game

Future Plans

I am excited to continue learning and improving my skills in C++ and game development. Some ideas for future improvements to this project include:

    Adding more levels and challenges
    Implementing a scoring system
    Adding more visual effects and animations
    Incorporating sound and music

I am open to suggestions and contributions, so feel free to open an issue or pull request if you have any ideas or feedback.
