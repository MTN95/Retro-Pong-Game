# A Retro Pong Game Using C++
a remake i made of the 70's classic retro pong

Welcome to my first C++ game project! This project uses raylib, a simple and easy-to-use library for creating 2D games.
Prerequisites

    A C++ compiler, such as Visual C++ or GCC 
    raylib, which can be installed using vcpkg or by manually building and installing the library

Running the Game / Building the game

To build the game, follow these steps:

    Clone this repository to your local machine
    Navigate to Retro-Pong-Game\Retro Pong 
    Open a terminal there and run this build command
    Replace "include" with your include path to raylib.h 
    Replace "lib" with you lib path to raylib .lib
    g++ RetroPong.cpp -o program.exe -O2 -Wall -I include/ -L lib/ -lraylib -lopengl -lgdi32 -lwinmm


Playing the Game

use the arrow keys - ←↑→↓ - to move the right paddle 
use the WASD keys to move the left paddle 

I am excited to continue learning and improving my skills in C++ and game development. Some ideas for future projects are:

    A Remake of the Classic Break-Out Game
    A Remake of the Classic Tetris Game
    and more to come!
    
As a beginner i am open to suggestions and contributions, so feel free to open an issue or pull request if you have any ideas or feedback.
And also if you are a beginner / a person that would like to team-up for a collabration of some sort, hit me up, i'd be happy to learn and grow as a team! .
